This is a federated learning related project which aims to analyse the performance metrics of the model with the use of federating techniques and also with the traditional machine leraning methods. The usecase choosen for the scenario was breast cancer detection system and datastet used was CDD-CESM. The main objective of the model is to implemnet a CNN model that could provide good evaluation metrics with the integration of federated leraning strategies
